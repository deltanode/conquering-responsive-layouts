Till now, we've looked at:

1. Using percentages for widths
2. Avoiding to set heights
3. Relative Units-em-rem
4. Why you shouldn't set font-sizes using em ?
          Or
   Why em can be Dangerous ?


5. Using max-width

   - The max-width property defines the maximum width of an element.
   - If the content is larger than the maximum width, it will automatically change the height of 
     the element.
   - If the content is smaller than the maximum width, the max-width property has no effect.

    Note: This prevents the value of the width property from becoming larger than max-width. 
          The value of the max-width property overrides the width property.
